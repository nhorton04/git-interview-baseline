# Interview Instructions

## Summary

In this repo you'll find a `README` file.

This is a historical snapshot of some documentation we provided around
collaboration using `git`.

The README has numerous areas for improvement.

Please fork this repo and make edits to improve the `README.md` file.

Leverage the power of `git` to document your thought process. Upon completion, please
email your Flatiron contact with the URL to your fork.

## Collaboration / Research

You are not to collaborate / review others' proposals / etc. Please make this your
own work that shows how *you* think. Plagiarism is unacceptable, "lifting ideas"
is unacceptable, "seeking inspiration" is unacceptable. The docs on `git` are
permissible, of course!

## Preserve `git`

Please preserve history and ensure your fork's last commit is a direct descendent
of the canonical `master` branch. We will be using `git diff` and similar tools
to see what you changed and why. Mucking with others' commits in a way that
damages the integrity of the git history graph is a strong negative signal.

## Time Commitment

Try to limit yourself to 1-2 hours. While there are _many_ possible edits,
prioritize your edits so that we can see how you sequence edits, what
stylistic changes you might make, and what your technical assessment is.

## Conclusion

There's no "right" answer here! We're trying to understand your voice, how
you would mesh with the team, and how you're going to help our learners have an
amazing experience.
